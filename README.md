## TODO:
 - repeat the analysis using different techniques, such as kernel density estimation or MLPs
 - calibration, for example for clustering
 - 2D+ outliers in-depth analysis
 - final talk preparation:
    - dataset description
    - preprocessing and initial data analysis
    - outliers detection and analysis
    - clustering and trivial classification to clusters
    - main classification
